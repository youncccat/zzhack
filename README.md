## Migrate database
The zzhack use SQLite as database, and use `sea-orm` to do migration, you may need to execute migrate before start server:
```shell
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://zzhack.db?mode=rwc sea-orm-cli migrate up
```

### Auto generate entities from database
`sea-orm-cli` provide ability to auto-generate entities and corresponding relations code from database, if you want to update the entities code, please run the following command:

```shell
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://zzhack.db?mode=rwc sea-orm-cli generate entity --with-serde serialize -o ./api/src/database/models
```


## How to start dev server
SSR is a experimental feature of Yew. you need to build both client bundle and server source code when the source code was changed.

We recommaned you install `cargo-watch` to trigger command execution. 
```shell
Cargo install cargo-watch
```

Go to the root of project. Build client bundle and watch:
```shell
cargo watch -C entry -i dist -i public -i styles -i zzhack.db -i assets -- trunk build
```

Then build server bin and watch:
```shell
cargo watch -C entry -- cargo run --features=ssr --bin zzhack_main -- --dir dist
```


### TailwindCSS
zzhack depends on `TailwindCSS` for CSS compilation, before this step you may need to install NPM dependencies:
```shell
pnpm i
```

And then run the following command to get start:
```shell
npx tailwindcss -i ./entry/styles/input.css -o ./entry/styles/output.css -- --watch
```
